This is a website I created as a school project. Feel free to make it your, but as with everything else, please give me credit.

**Glitch** is the friendly community where you'll build the app of your dreams. Glitch lets you instantly create, remix, edit, and host an app, bot or site, and you can invite collaborators or helpers to simultaneously edit code with you.

## Project Breakdown

### ← README.md

Do what it says and read it. It contains important information about remixing and other useful tips.

### ← index.html

This is the homescreen of the website. Put games and other files on another page by copying template.html and renaming the file to whatever you would like. For example, `newgame.html`

### ← style.css

This is not really used because due to technical issues, I decided to put all CSS Style Rulings within each individual file. Just copy

### ← script.js

It's a ghost town in this file. All that is in it are logs for debugging and time/date

### ← /views

All game pages are stored here. Use 'template.html' to create a new one
